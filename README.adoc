== Directory Config source

image:https://travis-ci.org/rmpestano/directory-config-source.svg[Build Status (Travis CI), link=https://travis-ci.org/rmpestano/directory-config-source]

This repository contains an example of a custom https://www.phillip-kruger.com/post/microprofile_config/[MicroProfile config source^] which reads properties from a file inside a directory.
 
=== Usage


*Given* a file present in /data/application.properties 

*And* the file has the following content:

----
config.example=example value
----
 
*When* the property is injected wih following code:

[source,java,linenums]
----
    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name = "config.example")
    private Provider<String> property;
----

*Then* the value `example value` should be retrieved

IMPORTANT: Any change to the file will automatically make update the properties.

TIP: This is specially useful in a container environment (e.g kubernetes) where pods can read properties from a file inside a volume, any change on this file affects configuration in `all pods`.
